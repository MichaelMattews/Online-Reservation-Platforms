# Online Reservation Platforms

## Introduction

In today's dynamic digital landscape, the hospitality industry stands at the intersection of technology and customer experience. As online reservation platforms become increasingly integral to how we engage with dining experiences, understanding the intricacies of customer behavior and merchant dynamics is paramount for success.

This project endeavors to delve into the rich reservoir of data provided by an online reservation platform, exploring the symbiotic relationship between customers and merchants.

By analyzing reservation data alongside merchant insights, our goal is to unearth actionable insights that can drive strategic decision-making for both customers and merchants alike. From identifying peak reservation times to uncovering emerging dining preferences, the findings from this analysis have the potential to revolutionize how we approach the digital dining landscape.

Through a combination of advanced data analytics tools such as Jupyter Notebook and visualization platforms like Tableau, we aim to unravel the underlying patterns and trends that shape the interactions within this ecosystem.
